    """
    Groups discrete branches by (start_name, end_name), computes edge weights,
    applies an optional Bayes Factor filter, and returns a GeoJSON FeatureCollection
    suitable for Kepler.gl ArcLayer.

    Edge weight semantics (in priority order):
      1. Posterior expected Markov jump count (mean over post-burnin MCMC trees)
         when ``mj_weights`` is provided — the standard phylogeographic metric.
      2. Raw count of state-change edges on the single MCC/HIPSTR tree (fallback)
         when ``mj_weights`` is None — a conditional consensus metric.

    Args:
        branches (list): List of branch dicts from discrete_space_processor.
        coordinate_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing location coordinates.
        bayes_filter (pd.DataFrame or dict, optional): Dataframe or dict with
            Bayes factors for (start_name, end_name) pairs.
        bf_threshold (float): Minimum BF value to retain a migration route.
        is_symmetrical (bool): Whether the underlying BEAST model is symmetric
            (reversible). When False (asymmetric), the BF lookup never falls
            back to the reverse direction B→A for an A→B route.
        mj_weights (dict, optional): Mapping (start_name, end_name) → posterior
            expected jump count from the BEAST log. When provided, replaces the
            Counter-based MCC edge count as the ``jump_weight``.

    Returns:
        geojson.FeatureCollection: Feature collection of arcs.
